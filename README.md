# droptop4daemon
Monitors DropTop4 and restarts it if RainMeter has crashed or the screen reserved space coords are wrong which would also indicate that there is an issue

Tested on Windows 11 Pro, PowerShell 7.4

Run as user context (system context won't work) as well as elevated

Use Windows task scheduler to run it at system start if desired
